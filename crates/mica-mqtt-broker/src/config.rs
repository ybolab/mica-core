//! Neither format is rumqttd's. rumqttd reads a large TOML of its own with a
//! router section, per-listener sections and a console block; none of that is
//! a decision anyone operating a device should have to make. What micad renders
//! into `/run/mica/mqtt-broker.toml` is three keys, and this module is the only
//! thing that reads them. The rumqttd `Config` is then built programmatically
//! in `main`, so the values that are not configurable stay out of reach.
